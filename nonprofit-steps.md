## Getting started in Ten Easy Steps
If you’re looking to start a Michigan nonprofit organization, you’re in the right place. This guide will help you file formation documents, obtain tax identification numbers, and register for fundraising.

### 1.  Before You Begin...
Before you begin, take a moment to consider if you should start a new non-profit organization. According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics, there were over 50,000 nonprofit organizations in Michigan in 2009. Before deciding a new nonprofit is necessary...
- Research if an organization already exists in your area that serves your cause. By working together you avoid diluting the effect of fundraising dollars and volunteer hours available in your geography.
- Consider fiscal sponsorship, in which an umbrella 501(c) organization incubates your charitable nonprofit. Fiscal sponsors permit your cause to receive tax-deductible donations and often handle administrative paperwork.

### 2.  Prepare to Incorporate
This article assumes that you will be creating a new nonprofit corporation, the most common legal structure. Check availability of your desired name. The legal name of the nonprofit corporation may not conflict with any other registered name.

**Name Search:**
[LARA - Corporation Division Business Entity Search database](http://www.dleg.state.mi.us/bcs_corp/sr_corp.asp)

**Name Reservation:** Optional
- Recruit initial directors for your nonprofit board of directors. Michigan law requires at least three board members for nonprofit corporations.

- Identify the nonprofit’s registered agent. This individual or company receives notice of lawsuit and other legal service for the corporation.

### 3.  File Michigan Nonprofit Articles of Incorporation
File articles of incorporation to create your non-profit corporation.

### 4. Establish Company Records, Bylaws, and Hold First Meeting
Your filed articles of incorporation are the first document for your nonprofit corporate records. Office supplies intended for nonprofit corporations help you stay organized and save time: optionally, get a company record book, seal, and templates.

Create bylaws (potentially using a template), which is the governing document for the nonprofit. This document defines how the corporation will run itself. You do not have to file them with the state; keep them in your company records.
Hold the first meeting of the board of directors. At this meeting, the nonprofit should approve the bylaws, elect additional directors, appoint officers, and approve initial resolutions such as opening a company bank account. Keep minutes of this meeting.
